  <h1> Questions 9.36-9.41 Page 123</h1>
  <p> 9.36 Tissue Fluid is an extracellular fluid which bathes the cells of most tissues, arriving via blood capillaries and being removed via the lympathic vessels.</p>
  <p> 9.37 First:Supplies cells with all their requirements.Second:Provides good environment for all the cells in the body.</p>
  <p> 9.38 Lymph is the fluid found inside lymph vessels, formed from tissue fluid.</p>
  <p> 9.39 Valves are found in larger lymph vessels and collecting vessels and are absent in the lymphatic capillaries. The valves is to prevent backflow of fluid, so that lymph eventually flows forward instead of falling backwards.</p>
  <p> 9.40 Neck and between lungs</p>
  <p> 9.41 Lymph vessels route lymph fluid through nodes throughout the body. Lymph nodes are small structures that work as filters for harmful substances. They contain immune cells that can help fight infection by attacking and destroying germs that are carried in through the lymph fluid.</p>

  <p> 1[A]Glucose first moves into the bloodstream upon absorption from the intestine. Specialized cellular transporters called sodium-dependent hexose transporters shuttle glucose across the cells that line the intestinal tract.Once through the intestinal lining, glucose is free to dissolve in the blood, and travels around the body. The intestinal transporters act quickly, such that blood glucose rises rapidly after a carbohydrate-containing meal. The pumping action of the heart then distributes blood glucose absorbed at the intestines to every part of the body.</p>
  <p> 1[B] It would go from the veins of the legs to join with other veins going in a similar direction through the vena cava ultimately leading back to the heart.</p>
  <p> 2[A]Arteries and veins are two of the body's main type of blood vessels through which blood flow in the body. The arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart while the veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissue capillaries back towards the heart.</p>
  <p> 2[B]Oxygenated blood is carrying more of oxygen to deliver to body tissues while deoxygenated blood is carrying more of carbondioxide to be expelled from body.</p>
  <p> 2[C]1. The atria stand for the upper chambers of the heart, while the ventricles are the lower chambers. 2. Atria act as receptors of deoxygenated blood, while ventricles receive blood from the left atria and force it into the aorta.</p>
  <p> 2[D]The main difference between red blood cells and white blood cells is in their respective functions. While red blood cells are responsible for transport of respiratory gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), white blood cells provide defense mechanisms for fighting foreign microorganisms entering the human organism.</p>
  <p> 2[E]BLOOD:1. It is red coloured fluid connective tissue that contains RBCs. 2. It is associated with circulation of Oxygen and Carbon dioxide. 3. It contains plasma, RBC's, WBC's, platelets and proteins. LYMPH:1. It is colourless fluid connective tissue in which RBCs are absent. 2. It helps in body defence and is a part of immune system. 3. It contains plasma, less number of WBC's and platelets. It lacks proteins.</p>
  <p> 2[F]Diastole and systole are two phases of the cardiac cycle. They occur as the heart beats, pumping blood through a system of blood vessels that carry blood to every part of the body. Systole occurs when the heart contracts to pump blood out, and diastole occurs when the heart relaxes after contraction.</p>
  <p> 2[G]The liver is connected to two large blood vessels, the hepatic artery and the portal vein. The hepatic artery carries blood from the aorta to the liver, whereas the portal vein carries blood containing the digested nutrients from the entire gastrointestinal tract, and also from the spleen and pancreas to the liver.</p>
  <p> 3[A] Plasma </p>
  <p> 3[B]White blood cells</p>
  <p> 3[C] Plasma </p>
  <p> 3[D] Red Blood cells</p>
  <p> 3[E] Platelets </p>
  <p> 3[F] Plasma </p>
  <p> 4. Arteries have a narrow internal diameter and thick muscular walls. This allows them to carry blood that is at a high pressure.</p>
  <p> Veins carry blood under low pressure from the capillaries and return the blood to the heart. The vein walls have thinner muscular walls than arteries and have a wider internal diameter. Veins contain valves to prevent the backflow of low-pressure blood.</p>
  <p> Capillaries are the site at which exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nutrients takes place. The structure of capillaries makes them very well suited for this function. As capillaries are only one cell thick and have very thin permeable walls this means that substances can diffuse out of them very easily.</p>
  <p> The cells that make up the xylem are adapted to their function: They lose their end walls so the xylem forms a continuous, hollow tube. They become strengthened by a substance called lignin . Lignin gives strength and support to the plant.</p>
  <p> The cells that make up the phloem are adapted to their function: Sieve tubes - specialised for transport and have no nuclei. Each sieve tube has a perforated end so its cytoplasm connects one cell to the next. Companion cells - transport of substances in the phloem requires energy.</p>
  <p> 5[A] Size of image= actual size of object x magnifcation. 3.2cm= 0.0007 x magnification. Magnification = Approx. 4,570</p>
  <p> 5[B] 1.Red blood cells have colour,but white doesn't. 2. Red blood cells are shaped like biconcave discs, while white is irregular. 3.RBC= 6-8 Micrometer in diameter,but WBC is 12-17 Micrometers</p>
  <p> 5[C] i. The main job of red blood cells, or erythrocytes, is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues and carbon dioxide as a waste product, away from the tissues and back to the lungs. Hemoglobin (Hgb) is an important protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of our body.</p>
  <p> ii.Red blood cells have adaptations that make them suitable for this: they contain haemoglobin - a red protein that combines with oxygen. they have no nucleus so they can contain more haemoglobin. they are small and flexible so that they can fit through narrow blood vessels.</p>
  <p> 6[A] 1<p>
  <p> 6[B] i. 0.65 seconds</p>
  <p> 6[B] ii. Approx 92.3 bpm</p>
  <p> 6[C] iso-volumetric relaxation</p>
  <p> 6[D] Blood flows from your right and left atria into your ventricles through the open tricuspid and mitral valves. When the ventricles are full, the tricuspid and mitral valves shut. This prevents blood from flowing backward into the atria while the ventricles contract.</p>
