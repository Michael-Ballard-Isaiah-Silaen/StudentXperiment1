  <h3>No.1 Which reaction is a neutralisation reaction?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> [AgNO3 + HCL= AgCl+HNO3]</li>
    <li> [CaCO3= CaO + CO2]</li>
    <li> [4Na+O2 = 2Na2O] </li>
    <li> [2NaOH + H2SO4 = Na2SO4 + 2H2O]</li>
  </ol>
<p> So, we need to highlight *Neutralisation*. Neutralisation is the process of neutralising an acid and a base with results therefore being salt and water</p>
<p> In short words, Acid + Base = Salt+ Water with acid = [H plus] and base being = [OH minus] </p>
<p> And the only eligible answer is <span class="bold">No.4</span> with Base being 2NaOH, H2SO4 being acid, Na2SO4 being salt, and 2H2O being water.</p>
<h3>No.2 Elements W and X are metals. Elements Y and Z are non-metals. The oxides of W,X,Y, and Z all form solutions when added to water. Which statement is correct?</h3>
<ol>
  <li> [The solution of the oxide of element W turns blue litmus red.]</li>
  <li> [The solution of the oxide of the element X fizzes when sodium carbonate is added]</li>
  <li> [The solution of the oxide of element Y has a pH greaten than pH 7]</li>
  <li> [The solution of the oxide of element Z fizzes when magnesium is added] </li>
</ol>
<p> As we know, metals= W and X= Base while non-metals=Y and Z= Acids. So the only correct statement is <span class="bold">No.4</span></p>
<h3> No.3 Which statement is correct?</h3>
<ol>
  <li> [A solutipn of magnesium oxide has a pH less than pH7]</li>
  <li> [A solution of sulfur dioxide has a pH greater than pH7]</li>
  <li> [Magnesium Oxide reacts with Nitric acid to make salt]</li>
  <li> [Sulfur Dioxide reacts with Hydrochloric acid to make a salt]</li>
</ol>
<p> Let us see and eliminate. Magnesium oxide = basic oxide = bigger than ph7. So, <span class="bold"> Option 1 is wrong </span></p>
<p> Sulfur = non metal= acidic oxide= pH less than 7.So, <span class="bold"> Option 2 is wrong</span></p>
<p> while at option 3, we have [Magnesium Oxide reacts with Nitric acid to make salt]. This is true, because <span class="bold"> Base [Magnesium Oxide] + Acid [Nitric acid]= salt [Mg[NO3]2] + water [H20]. So, Option 3 is correct</span></p>
<h3> No.4 Which oxide dissolves in water to form a basic solution?</h3>
<ol>
  <li> [Carbon Dioxide]</li>
  <li> [Nitrogen Dioxide]</li>
  <li> [Sodium Oxide]</li>
  <li> [Sulfur Dioxide]</li>
</ol>
<p> Let us analyze. Highlight *basic*.Basic= metal oxide, which Option 1,2,4 is not. So, <span class="bold">Answer is Option 3</span></p>
<h3> No.5 What is not a typical characteristic of acids? </h3>
<ol>
  <li> [They react with alkalis producing water] </li>
  <li> [They react with all metals producing hydrogen] </li>
  <li> [They react with carbonates producing Carbon dioxide] </li>
  <li> [They turn blue litmus paper red] </li>
</ol>
<p> To answer this question, let us look back at the rules. [1] Acid + Base = Salt + Water. [2] Metal+ acid= Salt + Hydrogen [3] Acid + metal carbonate = Salt + CO2 + H20. <span class="bold">Correct answer is option 2.</span></p>
<h3> No.6 Some properties of four oxides are listed.</h3>
<p>Oxide 1 reacts with both acids and alkalis to form Salts.</p>
<p>Oxide 2 reacts with Acids to form salts but does not react with alkalis</p>
<p>Oxide 3 reacts with alkalis to form salts but does not react with acids</p>
<p>Oxide 4 does not reacts with acids and alkalis</p>
<p>Which row describes the oxides?</p>

<p> <span class="bold">Answer is Option 2 </span> </p>

<p> Let us look at the question. Magnesium = metal = basic, Phosphorus and Chlorine = Non-metal= Acidic.<span class="bold">So, answer is Option 3</span></p>
<h3>No.8 Which of the following gases is a produced when an acid reacts with a metal?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>[Hydrogen]</li>
  <li>[Carbon Dioxide]</li>
  <li>[Carbon Monoxide]</li>
  <li>[Chlorine]</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bold">Answer is Option 1, Hydrogen </span></p>
<h3>No.9 Which of the following options is a pH value for an acidic solution?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>[8]</li>
  <li>[7]</li>
  <li>[9]</li>
  <li>[13]</li>
</ol>
<p> Know that acidic= pH lower than pH 7.<span class="bold"> Option 1 is the answer.</span></p>
<h3>No.10 Which one of the pH values below is alkaline?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>[3]</li>
  <li>[6]</li>
  <li>[7]</li>
  <li>[13]</li>
</ol>
<p> Note that alkaline= pH greater than 7.<span class="bold">Answer: Option 4</span></p>
