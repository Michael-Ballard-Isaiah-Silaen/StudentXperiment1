  <h3>Question No.1</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>[A] [5x+19][x-3] </li>
    <li>[B] {i} Because if we multiply [3x+7] and [2x+1], we get 6x^2+3x+14x+7 which is equal to = 6x^2+17x+7.</li>
    <li>{ii} First, we know Figure B is a square. So [x+8][x+8]= x^2+16x+64. If we see inside the square there is another cut-out square, whose dimension is x and 3. x multiplied by 3 is 3x, and therefore subtracting: x^2+16x+64 - 3x= x^2+13x+64.</li>
    <li>{iii} So, Figure A is equal to figure B. 6x^2+17x+7 = x^2+13x+64. Therefore, to have "0" on the right-hand side of the equation, we subtract 6x^2+17x+7 and x^2+13x+64. {6x^2+17x+7 - x^2+13x+64} = 0. So, 5x^2+4x-57=0.</li>
    <li>{iv} So, we need to go back to [A]. We factorize 5x^2+4x-57 into [5x+19][x-3]. There are 2 possible answers, but the only acceptable one is the answer with positive value. So x=3. Rectangle A= [3x+7][2x+1] = 16 x 7 = 112</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Question No.3</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> [A] {i} p x q </li>
    <li> {ii} p x q/2^2 </li>
    <li> {iii} p^3 </li>
    <li> [B] x= 1
             y= 2
             p= 2
             q= 4 </li>
    <li> 1 statement, the question is wrong, q^2/p supposed to be q^2 multiplied by p.If not, no value can work.To the corresponding correct question, the values are such of above</li>
  </ul>
